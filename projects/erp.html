			The purpose of this study is to determine if and how sexually ambiguous faces are categorized
differently than unambiguously male and female faces. The P3 event­ related potential (ERP) component, a long, slow, positive-going wave, ​w​as quantified during explicit categorization oddball task. Specifically examining the task­relevant P3b, we found both unambiguous faces and ambiguous faces elicited the P3 oddball response. A significantly larger mean amplitude and fractional area latency was observed for both unambiguous and ambiguous oddball faces compared to unambiguous context faces. There was no significant difference between unambiguous and ambiguous oddball responses. Reaction times for ambiguous oddball faces were significantly slower than both the unambiguous oddball and context faces. A significant difference was not found between ambiguous and unambiguous oddballs for P3 mean amplitude and fractional area latency. This may be attributed to immediate “other” categorization followed by conscious categorization, or real, undetected effects. Secondary analysis was conducted with the ambiguous oddball in a male context separated from ambiguous oddball in a female context. Remaining feminine attributes of ambiguous faces likely attenuated P3 amplitude and latency difference in the female compared to male context. These results support our hypothesis that ambiguous faces are processed differently than unambiguous faces.
